Those who walk this life path will face a unique set of challenges which are intended to teach you the lessons you will need to learn along the way to becoming the Independent Pioneer. Some of these challenges include struggling with co-dependency and the denial of self. To master the life path of The Innovator you must learn to believe in yourself. This means that even while it may be easier to remain dependent on others, opting for the comfortable way of life will only lead to dead ends and will leave you feel restless and unsatisfied.

Struggling with dependency will be a reoccurring theme throughout the course of your life.
